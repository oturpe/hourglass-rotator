Automatic rotator for an hourglass. The desired functionality is that an hourglass is turned around every time there is no more sand in the upper compartment. This is achieved with two pushbuttons that the shaft of the machine presses when it reached either of two possible upright positions. Registering a button press sets the machine to sleep for preprogrammed time that is suitable for the hourglass used and sets it to listen for presses of the other button. Change of rotational direction is achieved since the ac motor will by itself start to turn in another direction when it encounters an unmoving obstacle.

This piece of equipment was initially made as part of [Meta GrgureviÄ‡](http://www.metagrgurevic.com/)'s show in [31st Graphic Biennale](http://www.mglc-lj.si/bienale/31_graficni_bienale_) in Ljubljana.
