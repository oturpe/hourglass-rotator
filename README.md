Automatic rotator for an hourglass. The desired functionality is that an
hourglass is turned around every time there is no more sand in the upper
compartment. This is achieved with two pushbuttons that the shaft of the machine
presses when it reached either of two possible upright positions. Registering a
button press sets the machine to sleep for preprogrammed time that is suitable
for the hourglass used and sets it to listen for presses of the other button.
Change of rotational direction is achieved since the ac motor will by itself
start to turn in another direction when it encounters an unmoving obstacle.

This piece of equipment was initially made as part of [Meta Grgurevič]
(http://www.metagrgurevic.com/)'s show in [31st Graphic Biennale]
(http://www.mglc-lj.si/bienale/31_graficni_bienale_) in Ljubljana.
